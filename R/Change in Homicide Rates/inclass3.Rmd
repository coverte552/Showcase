## Introduction

This R script represents the homicide rates in U.S. states. The rates displayed on the map is the difference from 2022 to the average across 2019 to 2021. Everything mapped is either a steady rate, increased rate, or decreased rate - magnitude displayed by color and arrows. 
The data was found here: <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/homicide_mortality/homicide.htm>.

## Observations

Some observations can be made from this data following the trends. States like California or Texas are bigger states while having very little change. On the mention of bigger states, Alaska has the largest increase despite its rural geography. On the other hand, Wyoming has the greatest decrease despite also having a very rural geography. Alaska has had a relatively constant homicide rate, recently shooting into the higher end, while Wyoming had a low rate, and has now dropped heavily. Alaska's crime rate can be related to recent increases in drug and violent crime. For example, in 2022 26.85 Kilograms of fentanyl were seized in Alaska (Alaska Department of Public Safety, 2022b). Rape was on an increase, almost 25% in 2022, along with Child sexual abuse doubling from the previous year (Alaska Department of Public Safety, 2022b). However, we see Wyoming's homicide rates go down as other violent crimes also decreased. Sexual assault decreased around 10%, and almost 90% of sexual assaults involved no weapons (other than hands and feet) - leading to the decrease in homicides (Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation.). Through investigating each state with a high rate of change, we can begin to piece together what causes what. Looking at Wyoming and Alaska, the two states with the highest rates in each direction, I see that violent crime and sex crimes is heavily related to homicide rates.
